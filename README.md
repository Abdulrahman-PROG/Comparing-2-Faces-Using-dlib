# Comparing-2-Faces-Using-dlib
Facial Comparison Tool Using Dlib
Overview
This project implements a facial comparison tool using Dlib's low-level facial recognition capabilities. The tool detects faces, extracts facial landmarks, and computes feature descriptors to compare two faces for similarity. It is designed for applications such as identity verification, biometric analysis, or facial recognition systems.
The code is based on the implementation shared in my Kaggle notebook.
Features

Face Detection: Utilizes Dlib's frontal face detector to accurately locate faces in images.
Facial Landmark Extraction: Identifies key facial landmarks (e.g., eyes, nose, mouth) using Dlib’s shape predictor.
Face Comparison: Computes and compares facial feature descriptors to determine similarity between two faces.
Lightweight and Efficient: Leverages Dlib’s low-level APIs for robust and optimized performance.

Requirements
To run this project, you need the following dependencies:

Python 3.6+
Dlib
NumPy
OpenCV (cv2)
(Optional) Matplotlib for visualization

Install the required packages using:
pip install dlib numpy opencv-python matplotlib

Note: Installing Dlib may require additional setup, such as CMake and a C++ compiler. Refer to the Dlib documentation for detailed installation instructions.
Usage

Prepare Images: Ensure you have two images containing faces for comparison.
Run the Script:
Clone or download this repository.
Update the image paths in the script to point to your input images.
Execute the Python script:python face_comparison.py




Output: The script will output a similarity score or a boolean indicating whether the faces match based on a predefined threshold.

How It Works

Face Detection: The Dlib frontal face detector identifies face regions in the input images.
Landmark Detection: A pre-trained shape predictor extracts 68 facial landmarks from each detected face.
Feature Extraction: Dlib’s face recognition model computes a 128D feature vector for each face.
Comparison: The Euclidean distance between the feature vectors is calculated to determine similarity. A lower distance indicates a higher likelihood that the faces belong to the same person.

Example
import dlib
import cv2

# Load images
img1 = cv2.imread("face1.jpg")
img2 = cv2.imread("face2.jpg")

# Perform face comparison (see Kaggle notebook for full code)
# Result: Similarity score or match result

Applications
